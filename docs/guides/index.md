# Guides

These guides cover each Jim component in depth — what it does and how to use it.

- **[CLI Config Reference](cli.md)** — Complete reference for the `jim-run` TOML config: all sections, fields, and defaults.
- **[Data](data.md)** — How to load detector data from GWOSC, files, or frequency-domain arrays, and how to inject simulated signals.
- **[Likelihood](likelihood.md)** — Setting up `TransientLikelihoodFD` and `HeterodynedTransientLikelihoodFD`, including analytic marginalisation and fixed parameters.
- **[Prior](prior.md)** — Building priors with `CombinePrior` and the available 1-D prior distributions.
- **[Samplers](samplers.md)** — flowMC, BlackJAX NS-AW, NSS, and SMC; config reference, periodic parameters, and how to write your own sampler.
- **[Transforms](transforms.md)** — Sample transforms vs. likelihood transforms, and the built-in GW-specific transforms.
